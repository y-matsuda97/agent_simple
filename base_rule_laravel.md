# Coding Standards

* **Elegance and Readability:** Strive for elegant and clean code that is easy to understand and maintain, following Laravel's best practices.
* **PSR-12 Compliance:** Adhere to PSR-12 guidelines for code style. Use Pint to enforce this automatically.
* **Explicit over Implicit:** Favor explicit code that clearly communicates its intent. Utilize Laravel's features thoughtfully.
* **SOLID Principles:** Keep SOLID principles in mind when designing classes and services.
* **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each class and method should have a well-defined, single responsibility.
* **Reusable Components:** Develop reusable services, traits, and Blade components, favoring composition over inheritance.
* **Package Structure:** Organize code into logical namespaces and directories within the `app/` directory.
* **Comprehensive Type Annotations:** All function and method signatures and return types must have type declarations.
* **Detailed Docblocks:** All public methods and classes must have PHPDoc-style docblocks, explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions thrown.
* **Thorough Unit & Feature Testing:** Aim for high test coverage (90% or higher) using Pest or PHPUnit. All test files must be placed in the `tests/` directory. Test both common and edge cases.
* **Robust Exception Handling:** Use specific exception types, provide informative error messages, and handle exceptions gracefully using Laravel's exception handler. Implement custom exception classes when needed. Avoid catching generic `Exception` or `Throwable`.
* **Logging Practices:**
  - Use Laravel's `Log` facade. Configure channels in `config/logging.php`.
  - By default, logs go to `storage/logs/laravel.log`.
  - Laravel handles log rotation automatically.
  - Use appropriate log levels (`info`, `warning`, `error`, etc.) to log important events.
* **Debug Mode and Testing:** Never enable debug mode (`APP_DEBUG=true`) in production. Always run tests before deploying any changes.
* **Comments:**
  - Minimize comments in code; prioritize self-documenting code.
  - Only add comments for complex logic or algorithms that are not immediately obvious.
  - A method's purpose should be clear from its name and docblock.

# Laravel Development Practices

* **Eloquent Best Practices:** Avoid N+1 query problems by using eager loading (`with()`). Use accessors, mutators, and model observers where appropriate. Keep business logic out of models.
* **Service Container and Dependency Injection:** Leverage Laravel's service container for automatic resolution of dependencies. Bind services and repositories in service providers.
* **Repositories and Services:** Abstract database logic into Repositories and business logic into Service classes to keep controllers lean.
* **Routing:** Keep `routes/web.php` and `routes/api.php` clean by using controller classes. Group related routes and apply middleware.
* **Middleware:** Use middleware for handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and request manipulation.
* **Queues and Jobs:** Offload long-running tasks to background jobs to improve application response times.
* **Caching:** Use Laravel's cache facade to store frequently accessed, computationally expensive data.
* **Blade Templating:** Keep logic out of Blade templates. Use View Composers or dedicated Presenter classes to prepare data for views.

# Performance & Reliability

* **Asynchronous Processing:** Leverage Laravel Queues and Jobs for time-consuming tasks to ensure a non-blocking user experience.
* **Caching:** Apply Laravel's caching mechanisms (Redis, Memcached) for data, queries, and configuration.
* **Database Optimization:** Design database schemas efficiently, optimize queries using Laravel Debugbar or similar tools, and use indexes wisely.
* **Resource Monitoring:** Use tools like Laravel Telescope or New Relic to monitor application performance and identify bottlenecks.
* **Memory Efficiency:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially when processing large datasets with Eloquent collections. Use chunking methods like `chunk()` or `cursor()`.
* **Concurrency:** For high-traffic applications, configure queue workers appropriately using a process manager like Supervisor.

# Laravel API Rules

* **Data Validation:** Use Form Requests for rigorous request data validation and authorization in controllers.
* **Dependency Injection:** Effectively use Laravel's automatic dependency injection for managing dependencies in controllers and services.
* **API Resources:** Use API Resources (`JsonResource`) to transform Eloquent models into JSON responses, ensuring a consistent API output format.
* **Routing:** Define clear and RESTful API routes in `routes/api.php` using `Route::apiResource`.
* **Background Tasks:** Utilize Laravel Queues for any API-triggered background processing.
* **Security:** Implement robust authentication using Laravel Sanctum (for SPAs/mobile apps) or Passport (for OAuth 2.0).
* **Documentation:** Consider using tools like Scribe to automatically generate API documentation from your code.
* **Versioning:** Plan for API versioning from the start (e.g., using URL prefixes like `/api/v1/`).
* **CORS:** Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings in `config/cors.php`.

# Docker Configuration and Usage (Laravel Sail)

* **Container Structure:** The project is configured to run within a Laravel Sail environment, which provides a Docker-based local development experience.
* **Running the Environment:** Use `./vendor/bin/sail up` to start all containers. For interactive sessions, use `./vendor/bin/sail bash`.
* **Artisan Commands:** Run Artisan commands within the container: `./vendor/bin/sail artisan <command>`.
* **Port Mapping:** Sail maps the application port (default: 80) and other service ports (database, Redis, etc.).
* **Volume Mounting:** The current directory is mounted into the container, ensuring code changes are reflected immediately.
* **Environment Variables:** All environment-specific configurations should be in the `.env` file.
* **Dependency Management:** When adding new Composer dependencies, run `./vendor/bin/sail composer require <package>`. For Node dependencies, use `./vendor/bin/sail npm install`. If you modify the `docker-compose.yml` or Dockerfiles published by Sail, rebuild with `./vendor/bin/sail build --no-cache`.

# Code Example Requirements

* All functions must include PHP type declarations.
* Provide clear, PHPDoc-style docblocks.
* Key logic should be annotated with comments if it's complex.
* Provide usage examples in the `tests/` directory.
* Include proper error handling using Laravel's exception system.
* Use `Pint` for code formatting.
* Always run tests (`./vendor/bin/sail test`) before committing or deploying changes.

# Development Phase Guidelines
1. Prototyping Phase (Phase 1)
* Prioritize **getting something working** over writing perfect code or configurations.
* Use `logs/changelog.md` as a development log to track daily progress, decisions, and experiments.

2. Refinement Phase (Phase 2)
* Once the prototype works reliably, refactor code into appropriate services, repositories, and other design patterns.
* Introduce robust logging, error handling, and apply clear modularization and interface design.
* Apply coding standards and best practices strictly as the codebase matures.

# Others

* **Prioritize new features in PHP 8.2+.**
* **When explaining code, provide clear logical explanations.**
* **When making suggestions, explain the rationale and potential trade-offs.**
* **If code examples span multiple files, clearly indicate the file names.**
* **Do not over-engineer solutions. Strive for simplicity and maintainability while remaining efficient.**
* **Favor modularity, but avoid over-modularization.**
* **Use modern and efficient libraries when appropriate, but justify their use and ensure they don't add unnecessary complexity.**
* **When providing solutions or examples, ensure they are self-contained and executable.**
* **Always consider the security implications of your code, especially when dealing with user inputs (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).**
* **Actively use and promote best practices for Laravel development.**
* **Always run tests in the `tests/` directory after developing any changes to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.**
