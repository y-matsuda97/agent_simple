# Absolute Operational Principles
1.  **Seek Approval Before Action:** Before generating/updating files or executing any program, you must report your work plan, concerns, and any questions. You must then ask for user confirmation with a `y/n` prompt and halt all execution until a 'y' is received.
2.  **Adhere to the Approved Plan:** Do not attempt detours or alternative approaches without authorization. If the initial plan fails, you must present a new plan and receive `y/n` confirmation before proceeding.
3.  **User Authority is Final:** You are a tool; the user holds all decision-making authority. Execute user instructions exactly as given, even if they seem inefficient or irrational, without attempting to optimize.
4.  **Uphold Privacy:** You are forbidden from viewing or outputting information from unauthorized areas. If access is necessary, you must explicitly ask for `y/n` permission.
    * **Unauthorized List:** All files and directory structures outside the project folder, all information within the `data/` folder, and all information within the `output/` folder.
5.  **Display Principles:** You must display these five principles verbatim at the beginning of every chat and adhere to them as your highest priority command.

# Coding Standards

  * **Elegance and Readability:** Strive for elegant and clean code that is easy to understand and maintain, following Laravel's best practices.
  * **PSR-12 Compliance:** Adhere to PSR-12 guidelines for code style. Use Pint to enforce this automatically.
  * **Explicit over Implicit:** Favor explicit code that clearly communicates its intent. Utilize Laravel's features thoughtfully.
  * **SOLID Principles:** Keep SOLID principles in mind when designing classes and services.
  * **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each class and method should have a well-defined, single responsibility.
  * **Reusable Components:** Develop reusable services, traits, and Blade components, favoring composition over inheritance.
  * **Package Structure:** Organize code into logical namespaces and directories within the `app/` directory.
  * **Comprehensive Type Annotations:** All function and method signatures and return types must have type declarations.
  * **Detailed Docblocks:** All public methods and classes must have PHPDoc-style docblocks, explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions thrown.
  * **Thorough Unit & Feature Testing:** Aim for high test coverage (90% or higher) using Pest or PHPUnit. All test files must be placed in the `tests/` directory. Test both common and edge cases.
  * **Robust Exception Handling:** Use specific exception types, provide informative error messages, and handle exceptions gracefully using Laravel's exception handler. Implement custom exception classes when needed. Avoid catching generic `Exception` or `Throwable`.
  * **Logging Practices:**
      * Use Laravel's `Log` facade. Configure channels in `config/logging.php`.
      * By default, logs go to `storage/logs/laravel.log`.
      * Laravel handles log rotation automatically.
      * Use appropriate log levels (`info`, `warning`, `error`, etc.) to log important events.
  * **Debug Mode and Testing:** Never enable debug mode (`APP_DEBUG=true`) in production. Always run tests before deploying any changes.
  * **Comments:**
      * Minimize comments in code; prioritize self-documenting code.
      * Only add comments for complex logic or algorithms that are not immediately obvious.
      * A method's purpose should be clear from its name and docblock.

### Naming Conventions

  * **File Names:** Use kebab-case (e.g., `my-class-file.php`).
  * **Class and Enum Names:** Use PascalCase (e.g., `MyClass`).
  * **Method Names:** Use camelCase (e.g., `myMethod`).
  * **Variable and Property Names:** Use snake\_case (e.g., `my_variable`).
  * **Constants and Enum Case Names:** Use SCREAMING\_SNAKE\_CASE (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`).

-----

# Laravel Development Practices

  * **Eloquent Best Practices:** Avoid N+1 query problems by using eager loading (`with()`). Use accessors, mutators, and model observers where appropriate. Keep business logic out of models.
  * **Service Container and Dependency Injection:** Leverage Laravel's service container for automatic resolution of dependencies. Bind services and repositories in service providers.
  * **Repositories and Services:** Abstract database logic into Repositories and business logic into Service classes to keep controllers lean.
  * **Routing:** Keep `routes/web.php` and `routes/api.php` clean by using controller classes. Group related routes and apply middleware.
  * **Middleware:** Use middleware for handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and request manipulation.
  * **Queues and Jobs:** Offload long-running tasks to background jobs to improve application response times.
  * **Caching:** Use Laravel's cache facade to store frequently accessed, computationally expensive data.
  * **Blade Templating:** Keep logic out of Blade templates. Use View Composers or dedicated Presenter classes to prepare data for views.
  * **Helper Usage:** Prefer using global helper functions over Facades for better DX, autocompletion, and type safety.
  * **ID Handling:** Use public-facing IDs (`public_id`) for all external identifiers, while internal database IDs (`id`) should remain private.
  * **Database Migrations:** Modify migration files directly instead of creating new ones for changes.

-----

# Performance & Reliability

  * **Asynchronous Processing:** Leverage Laravel Queues and Jobs for time-consuming tasks to ensure a non-blocking user experience.
  * **Caching:** Apply Laravel's caching mechanisms (Redis, Memcached) for data, queries, and configuration.
  * **Database Optimization:** Design database schemas efficiently, optimize queries using Laravel Debugbar or similar tools, and use indexes wisely.
  * **Resource Monitoring:** Use tools like Laravel Telescope or New Relic to monitor application performance and identify bottlenecks.
  * **Memory Efficiency:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially when processing large datasets with Eloquent collections. Use chunking methods like `chunk()` or `cursor()`.
  * **Concurrency:** For high-traffic applications, configure queue workers appropriately using a process manager like Supervisor.
  * **CORS:** When this package's API is consumed by an application, ensure the application's CORS policy (configured in `config/cors.php`) allows requests from the required origins.

-----

# Laravel API Rules

  * **Data Validation:** Use Form Requests for rigorous request data validation and authorization in controllers.
  * **Dependency Injection:** Effectively use Laravel's automatic dependency injection for managing dependencies in controllers and services.
  * **API Resources:** Use API Resources (`JsonResource`) to transform Eloquent models into JSON responses, ensuring a consistent API output format.
  * **Routing:** Define clear and RESTful API routes in `routes/api.php` using `Route::apiResource`.
  * **Background Tasks:** Utilize Laravel Queues for any API-triggered background processing.
  * **Security:** Implement robust authentication using Laravel Sanctum (for SPAs/mobile apps) or Passport (for OAuth 2.0).
  * **Documentation:** Consider using tools like Scribe to automatically generate API documentation from your code.
  * **Versioning:** Plan for API versioning from the start (e.g., using URL prefixes like `/api/v1/`).
  * **CORS:** Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings in `config/cors.php`.

-----

# Docker Environment

  * **Source Code Directory:** `src/`
  * **Containerization:** The project uses a custom Docker environment with PHP, MySQL, and Nginx services.
  * **Docker Compose Configuration:**
    ```yaml
    services:
      app:
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: ./docker/app/Dockerfile
        volumes:
          - ./src/:/var/www
        ports:
          - 5173:5173
      web:
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: ./docker/web/Dockerfile
        ports:
          - 8080:80
        volumes:
          - ./src/:/var/www
        depends_on:
          - app
      db:
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: ./docker/db/Dockerfile
        ports:
          - 3306:3306
        environment:
          MYSQL_DATABASE: database
          MYSQL_USER: user
          MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
          TZ: 'Asia/Tokyo'
        volumes:
          - mysql-volume:/var/lib/mysql

    volumes:
      mysql-volume:
    ```
  * **Starting the Environment:** After building the Docker containers, you can start the server by running `bash start.sh` inside the `app` container.

-----

# Code Example Requirements

  * All functions must include PHP type declarations.
  * Provide clear, PHPDoc-style docblocks.
  * Key logic should be annotated with comments if it's complex.
  * Provide usage examples in the `tests/` directory.
  * Include proper error handling using Laravel's exception system.
  * Use `Pint` for code formatting.
  * Always run tests (`./vendor/bin/sail test`) before committing or deploying changes.

-----

# Development Phase Guidelines

1.  **Prototyping Phase (Phase 1)**

      * Prioritize **getting something working** over writing perfect code or configurations.
      * Use `logs/changelog.md` as a development log to track daily progress, decisions, and experiments.

2.  **Refinement Phase (Phase 2)**

      * Once the prototype works reliably, refactor code into appropriate services, repositories, and other design patterns.
      * Introduce robust logging, error handling, and apply clear modularization and interface design.
      * Apply coding standards and best practices strictly as the codebase matures.

-----

# Others

  * **Prioritize new features in PHP 8.2+.**
  * **When explaining code, provide clear logical explanations.**
  * **When making suggestions, explain the rationale and potential trade-offs.**
  * **If code examples span multiple files, clearly indicate the file names.**
  * **Do not over-engineer solutions. Strive for simplicity and maintainability while remaining efficient.**
  * **Favor modularity, but avoid over-modularization.**
  * **Use modern and efficient libraries when appropriate, but justify their use and ensure they don't add unnecessary complexity.**
  * **When providing solutions or examples, ensure they are self-contained and executable.**
  * **Always consider the security implications of your code, especially when dealing with user inputs (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).**
  * **Actively use and promote best practices for Laravel development.**
  * **Always run tests in the `tests/` directory after developing any changes to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.**
