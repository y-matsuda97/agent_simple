# Absolute Operational Principles
You must display these five principles verbatim at first.
1. **Seek Approval Before Action:** Before generating/updating files or executing any program, you must report your work plan, concerns, and any questions. You must then ask for user confirmation with a `y/n` prompt and halt all execution until a 'y' is received. 
2. **Adhere to the Approved Plan:** Adhere strictly to the approved plan. If the initial plan fails, you must present a new plan and receive `y/n` confirmation before proceeding. Execute user instructions exactly as given, as the user holds all decision-making authority. 
3. **Document Your Work:** Upon completion of the approved work, you must record the tasks performed and any relevant notes for future development in `CHANGELOG.md`. 
4.  **Uphold Privacy:** You are forbidden from viewing or outputting information from unauthorized areas. If access is necessary, you must explicitly ask for `y/n` permission.
    * **Unauthorized List:** All files and directory structures outside the project folder, `.env' file, all information with in the `data/` folder, and all information within the `output/` folder.
5.  **Display Principles:** You must display these five principles verbatim at the beginning of every chat and adhere to them as your highest priority command.

# Coding Standards

* **Elegance and Readability:** Strive for elegant and Pythonic code that is easy to understand and maintain.
* **PEP 8 Compliance:** Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines for code style, with Ruff as the primary linter and formatter.
* **Explicit over Implicit:** Favor explicit code that clearly communicates its intent over overly concise, implicit code.
* **Zen of Python:** Keep the Zen of Python in mind when making design decisions.
* **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each module/file should have a well-defined, single responsibility.
* **Reusable Components:** Develop reusable functions and classes, favoring composition over inheritance.
* **Package Structure:** Organize code into logical packages and modules.
* **Comprehensive Type Annotations:** All functions, methods, and class members must have type annotations, using the most specific types possible.
* **Detailed Docstrings:** All functions, methods, and classes must have Google-style docstrings, thoroughly explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions raised. Include usage examples where helpful.
* **Thorough Unit Testing:** Aim for high test coverage (90% or higher) using `pytest`. All test files must be placed in the `tests/` directory. Test both common and edge cases.
* **Robust Exception Handling:** Use specific exception types, provide informative error messages, and handle exceptions gracefully. Implement custom exception classes when needed. Avoid bare `except` clauses.
* **Logging Practices:**
    * Configure logging to write to `logs/log.log`
    * Implement log rotation when the file size reaches 10MB
    * Name rotated files as `log.log.YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM`
    * Keep a maximum of 5 backup files, deleting older ones
    * Use the `logging` module judiciously to log important events, warnings, and errors
* **Debug Mode and Testing:** Always run code in debug mode first to catch potential issues early. Execute tests before deploying any changes.
* **Comments:**
    * Minimize comments in code, prioritize self-documenting code.
    * Only add comments for special code patterns that are not immediately obvious.
    * A function's purpose should be clear from its docstring.

# ML / LLM Practices

* **Experiment Configuration:** Use `hydra` or `yaml` for clear and reproducible experiment configurations.
* **Data Pipeline Management:** Employ scripts or tools like `dvc` to manage data preprocessing and ensure reproducibility.
* **Model Versioning:** Utilize `git-lfs` or cloud storage to track and manage model checkpoints effectively.
* **Experiment Logging:** Maintain comprehensive logs of experiments, including parameters, results, and environmental details.
* **LLM Prompt Engineering:** Dedicate a module or file to managing prompt templates with version control.
* **Context Handling:** Implement efficient context management for conversations, using suitable data structures like deques.

# Performance & Reliability

* **Asynchronous Programming:** Leverage `async` and `await` for I/O-bound operations to maximize concurrency.
* **Caching:** Apply `functools.lru_cache`, `@cache` (Python 3.9+), or `fastapi.Depends` caching where appropriate.
* **Resource Monitoring:** Use `psutil` or similar to monitor resource usage and identify bottlenecks.
* **Memory Efficiency:** Ensure proper release of unused resources to prevent memory leaks.
* **Concurrency:** Employ `concurrent.futures` or `asyncio` to manage concurrent tasks effectively.
* **Database Best Practices:** Design database schemas efficiently, optimize queries, and use indexes wisely.

# FastAPI API Rules

* **Data Validation:** Use Pydantic models for rigorous request and response data validation.
* **Dependency Injection:** Effectively use FastAPI's dependency injection for managing dependencies.
* **Routing:** Define clear and RESTful API routes using FastAPI's `APIRouter`.
* **Background Tasks:** Utilize FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` or integrate with Celery for background processing.
* **Security:** Implement robust authentication and authorization (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
* **Documentation:** Auto-generate API documentation using FastAPI's OpenAPI support.
* **Versioning:** Plan for API versioning from the start (e.g., using URL prefixes or headers).
* **CORS:** Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings correctly.

# Docker Configuration and Usage

* **Container Structure:** The project uses a CUDA-enabled Docker container with Python 3.11 and necessary ML libraries.
* **Running Code in Containers:** Use `docker-compose up` to start the container environment. For interactive sessions, use `docker-compose exec app bash`.
* **GPU Passthrough:** The docker-compose.yml is configured to pass through NVIDIA GPU capabilities for ML workloads.
* **Port Mapping:** Port 5678 is mapped for debugging or service access.
* **Volume Mounting:** The current directory is mounted to `/work` in the container, ensuring code changes are reflected immediately.
* **Long-Running Processes:** For training or inference jobs, use `docker-compose exec app python your_script.py` rather than modifying the default command.
* **Environment Variables:** Add environment-specific configurations to the `.devcontainer/.env` file (uncomment the relevant line in docker-compose.yml).
* **Resource Allocation:** Configure memory and CPU limits in docker-compose.yml for production deployments.
* **Container Persistence:** Be aware that container data outside mounted volumes is ephemeral and will be lost when containers are removed.
* **Dependency Management:** When adding new dependencies, update the requirements files and rebuild the container with `docker-compose build`.

# Code Example Requirements

* All functions must include type annotations.
* Provide clear, Google-style docstrings.
* Key logic should be annotated with comments.
* Provide usage examples in the `tests/` directory or as a `__main__` section.
* Include error handling.
* Use `ruff` for code formatting.
* Always run code in debug mode and execute tests before deployment.

# Development Phase Guidelines
## **Phase 1: Prototyping**
In this initial phase, the primary goal is rapid development and integration.
* **Prioritize Functionality:** Focus on getting a working prototype. Perfect code or complex configurations are not the priority.
* **Direct Integration:** Call auxiliary scripts directly from script file (e.g. session_250626_YM_001.py) to test the end-to-end workflow early.
* **No Error Hiding:** **Do not use `try-except` blocks.** Allowing the program to crash immediately on an error makes debugging faster and more efficient.
* **Log Progress:** Use `logs/changelog.md` to document daily progress, key decisions, and experimental results.
## **Phase 2: Refinement**
Once the prototype is stable, focus on making the codebase robust and maintainable.
* **Modular Configuration:** Split monolithic configuration files into logical subfolders (e.g., `conf/model/`, `conf/data/`).
* **Proper Error Handling:** Introduce comprehensive `try-except` blocks, logging, and well-defined error-handling strategies.
* **Clean Code:** Implement clear modularization, design well-defined interfaces, and strictly adhere to coding standards.

# Others

* **Prioritize new features in Python 3.11.**
* **When explaining code, provide clear logical explanations.**
* **When making suggestions, explain the rationale and potential trade-offs.**
* **If code examples span multiple files, clearly indicate the file names.**
* **Do not over-engineer solutions. Strive for simplicity and maintainability while remaining efficient.**
* **Favor modularity, but avoid over-modularization.**
* **Use the most modern and efficient libraries when appropriate, but justify their use and ensure they don't add unnecessary complexity.**
* **When providing solutions or examples, ensure they are self-contained and executable without requiring extensive modifications.**
* **Always consider the security implications of your code, especially when dealing with user inputs and external data.**
* **Actively use and promote best practices for the specific tasks at hand (LLM app development, data cleaning, demo creation, etc.).**
* **Always run code in debug mode and execute tests in the `tests/` directory after developing any changes to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.**

# Shared Files for New Projects

To accelerate onboarding and ensure consistency, reuse common files from the `../agent_simple/python_project` directory (located in the root directory) when initializing a new project.
If you modify any of the shared files (e.g., Dockerfile, logger utility, etc.), you must also update the corresponding file in `../agent_simple/python_project`.
